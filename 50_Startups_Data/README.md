# 📊 Multi Linear Regression on 50_Startups Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **prediction model for company profit** using the **50_Startups dataset**.  
We apply **Multi Linear Regression (MLR)** and explore transformations to improve prediction accuracy.  
The workflow includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, **model building**, and **evaluation**.
